#notes for future me


1. In Express.js, router.param() is a method used to handle dynamic parameters in route paths. It allows you to define middleware functions that will be executed when certain parameters are present in the URL of a request. see checkId function in tourController as well as check doumentation for router.param for further details

----------------------------------------------------

2. we can create instance from our modal and then call a save method to upload the data:

const createNewTour = new Tour({ ...req.body });
createNewTour
    .save()
    .then((doc) => {
      return res.status(200).json(doc);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      return res.status(500).json({
        status: "fail",
        message: "tour name must be unique",
        error: err,
      });
    }); 

or 

we can just directly pass the data in the modal using create method and await the response.   

const newTour = await Tour.create({ ...req.body });

----------------------------------------------------

3. its a common practice in Restful API that when the delete req happens we don't send any data.

----------------------------------------------------

4. we don't save imaged in the database itself but rather store their names on the database so later on we can actually get the names from database and get actual images from file system in our computer.
